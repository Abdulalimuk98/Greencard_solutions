Greencard Solutions (Recycling Incentive Scheme), 2020

GreenCard is an innovative solution to the problem of indiscriminate waste dumping in Nigeria, specifically the FCT (Federal Capital Territory). The system works with partnering banks to incentivise its customers to recycle (more often) through rewards such as cash back at participating stores, airtime, data and even hard currency. The system also works with waste merchants to create a wider and more efficient network for waste collection, sorting and recycling by providing a robust backend API for keeping track of waste depositing, scheduling collections and distributing payments and rewards on time. 

Users sign up either through the GreenCard app or via their mobile banking app (provided their bank is an official GreenCard partner). They can then opt to schedule a collection time or find a drop off point close to their location. They will then be prompted to indicate the type and quantity of waste they will be recycling (i.e. 50 plastic 60cl bottles). This will generate a quote based on estimated prices provided by our partnering waste merchants (i.e. 5 naira per bottle). Once the user has confirmed the collection time and location, a courier is dispatched to collect their recycling and take it to the sorting facility. After the recycling has been accounted for and sorted, users can expect to be able to redeem their rewards via the app within 3 business days.
